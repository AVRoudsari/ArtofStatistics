Here is its [Amazon page](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Statistics-Learning-Pelican-Books/dp/0241398630)

This repository contains data and R code for the Figures and Tables in Art of Statistics.  They should all work in RStudio.

* It is not yet complete, and will change and improve, including a blogdown web page. 

* The graphics were originally mainly produced in basic R, but (with much appreciated assistance) these have been mainly revised into ggplot2 - sometimes both versions are provided for comparison.  However I do not pretend to have any particular skill in using R or ggplot, and no doubt many improvements could be made.

* Many packages are used and will need to be installed, for example using  install.packages("ggplot2")

* While the individual files can be downloaded, it is probably easiest to download a zipped repository using the green download button.
