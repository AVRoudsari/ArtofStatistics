This repository contains data and R code for the Figures and Tables in Art of Statistics.  They should all work in RStudio.

* It is not yet complete, and will change and improve, including a blogdown web page. 

* The graphics were originally mainly produced in basic R, but (with much appreciated assistance) these have been mainly revised into ggplot2 - sometimes both versions are provided for comparison.  However I do not pretend to have any particular skill in using R or ggplot, and no doubt many improvements could be made.

* Many packages are used and will need to be installed, for example using  install.packages("ggplot2")

* While the individual files can be downloaded, it is probably easiest to download a zipped repository using the green download button.

# Errata

* page 86. Line -9. "2,190" should read "2,910"
* page 212 Figure 8.3 – the label ‘Head’ on the first lower branch should be 'Tail'
* page 222, line -3, '2014' should be '2013'
* page 225 legend to Figure 8.5, '2014' should be '2013'
* page 232. Figure 9.1b is incorrect - the bars should have heights 0.32, 0.64, 0.04, as described in the footnote.  Figures 9.1e and 9.1f are incorrect, the peak should be centred at 0.2, and 9.1e has an apparent layer of probability smeared over the whole range.  The correct version of Figure 9.1 can be found on the Github repository  
* page 235 Legend to Figure 9.2, line 2, after 'UK', add '(except Wales)'
* page 254 In the legend to Figure 10.1 'solid' should be replaced by 'dashed'  
* page 319 Table 11.1 shows a 'combined evidence' total of 6.5 million, but in the text on p.318 it states 6.7 million. (6.5 million uses the rounded numbers in the Table, 6.7 million uses unrounded numbers)
* Page 342, start of the last paragraph,'Ioannadis' is misspelled (having spelt it correctly as 'Ioannidis'at the start of the previous paragraph ) 
* page 375 Headings of Table 13.1.  'O' in 'Others' is printed as a zero rather than an 'O'
* page 416 Note 7 ends with 'p.000', which should be 'p.92'
