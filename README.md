Here is its [Amazon page](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Statistics-Learning-Pelican-Books/dp/0241398630)

This repository contains data and R code for the Figures and Tables in Art of Statistics.  They should all work in RStudio.

* It is not yet complete, and will change and improve, including a blogdown web page. 

* The graphics were originally mainly produced in basic R, but (with much appreciated assistance) these have been mainly revised into ggplot2 - sometimes both versions are provided for comparison.  However I do not pretend to have any particular skill in using R or ggplot, and no doubt many improvements could be made.

* Many packages are used and will need to be installed, for example using  install.packages("ggplot2")

* While the individual files can be downloaded, it is probably easiest to download a zipped repository using the green download button.

Suggestions for improvements to david@statslab.cam.ac.uk

# Errata

* page 86. Line -9. "2,190" should read "2,910"
* page 232. Figure 9.1b is incorrect - the bars should have heights 0.32, 0.64, 0.04, as described in the footnote.  Figures 9.1e and 9.1f are incorrect, the peak should be centred at 0.2.  The correct version of Figure 9.1 can be found on the Github repository
